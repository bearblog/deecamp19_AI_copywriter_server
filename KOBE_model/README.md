## Prerequisites

- Linux or macOS
- Python 3
- PyTorch >= 1.0.1
- NVIDIA GPU + CUDA cuDNN

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lumonk/KOBE
cd KOBE
```

Please install dependencies by

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset

- We use the **TaoDescribe** dataset, which contains 2,129,187 product titles and descriptions in Chinese.
- (optional) You can download the un-preprocessed dataset from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nnnq9eobmn6u44v/AAA7s4YkVbslS-6slDIOn4MYa) or [here (for users in China)](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=9717).

### Training
#### Download preprocessed data

- First, download the preprocessed TaoDescribe dataset by running `python scripts/download_preprocessed_tao.py`.
    - If you're in regions where Dropbox are blocked (e.g. Mainland China), try `python scripts/download_preprocessed_tao.py --cn`.
- (optional) You can peek into the `data/aspect-user/preprocessed/test.src.str` and `data/aspect-user/preprocessed/test.tgt.str`, which include product titles and descriptions in the test set, respectively. In src files, `<x> <y>` means this product is intended to show with aspect `<x>` and user category `<y>`. Note: this slightly differs from the `<A-1>`, `<U-1>` format descripted in the paper but basically they are the same thing. You can also peek into
    `data/aspect-user/preprocessed/test.supporting_facts_str` to see the knowledge we extracted from dbpedia for the corresponding product.

#### Start training

- Different configurations for models in the paper are stored under the `configs/` directory. Launch a specific experiment with `--config` to specify the path to your desired model config and `--expname` to specify the name/number of this experiment which will be used in logging.
- We include three config files here: the baseline, KOBE without adding external knowledge, and full KOBE model.

- Baseline

```bash
python core/train.py --config configs/baseline.yaml --expname baseline
```

- KOBE without adding knowledge

```bash
python core/train.py --config configs/aspect_user.yaml --expname aspect-user
```

- KOBE

```bash
python core/train.py --config configs/aspect_user_knowledge.yaml --expname aspect-user-knowledge
```

The default `batch size` is set to 64.
If you are having OOM problems, try to decrease it with the flag `--batch-size`.

#### Track training progress

- You can use TensorBoard. It can take (roughly) 12 hours for the training to stop. To get comparable results in paper, you need to train for even longer (by editing `epoch` in the config files). However, the current setting is enough to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

```bash
tensorboard --logdir experiments --port 6006
```

### Generation

- During training, the generated descriptions on the test set is saved at `experiments/<expname>/candidate.txt` and the ground truth is at `reference.txt`. This is generated by greedy search to save time in training and doesn't block repetitive terms.
- To do beam search with `beam width = 10`, run the following command.

```bash
python core/train.py --config configs/baseline.yaml --mode eval --restore experiments/finals-baseline/checkpoint.pt --expname eval-baseline --beam-size 10
```

### Evaluation

- BLEU
- DIVERSITY

## Experiment results

- baseline 
- aspect-user: 
- aspect-User_2: aspect, no user, encoder layers = 4
- sapect-user-know :
